# Profitable Apps for the App Store and Google Play
The aim of this project is to analyze data in order to find profitable app profiles for the App Store and Google Play markets.

Our company builds Android and iOS mobile apps, which we make available and free to download on Google Play and the App Store. Our revenue solely depends on in-app advertisements. Therefore, number of users is important, as more users that engage with ads should relate to increased revenue. Our goal for this project is to analyze the data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
